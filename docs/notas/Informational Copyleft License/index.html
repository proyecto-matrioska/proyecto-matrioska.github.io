<pre><code>Informational Copyleft License (ICL)

Version 0.4, September 27, 2023.

Preamble:

This Informational Copyleft License (ICL) is a copyleft license designed to promote open collaboration and perpetual openness in artistic, literary, conceptual, philosophical, scientific, theoretical, and technological works. It is based on the principles of the GNU General Public License version 3.0 (GPLv3) and the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike license (CC BY-SA).

Definitions:

1. &quot;Work&quot; refers to any artistic, literary, conceptual, philosophical, scientific, theoretical, or technological work, database, or other material to which the licensor applied this license, including but not limited to academic publications, internet publications (such as blog or social network posts), images, videos, audios, diagrams, visual schemas, computer programs, translations, and any kind of software and hardware implementation, designs, and specifications.

2. &quot;Derivative Work&quot; refers to any work that is based on or derived from the original Work, including all modifications, additions, translations, adaptations, compilations, and any kind of software and hardware implementations, designs, and specifications.

3. &quot;Incompatible Technology&quot; refers to any technology that cannot be released under the terms of this license due to reasons beyond the control of the licensor, which prohibits its combination or use with the Work.

License Terms:

1. Grant of Rights:

   a) The licensor hereby grants the licensee the right to freely use, study, copy, share, and modify the Work and its Derivative Works, whether for non-commercial or commercial purposes, provided that the resulting Derivative Works are also released under the terms of this license.

   b) The licensor grants the perpetual right to access, reproduce, distribute, publicly perform, publicly display, and create Derivative Works based on the Work, subject to the conditions of this license.

2. Compatibility with GPL version 3.0 and CC BY-SA:

   a) Any Work or Derivative Work that incorporates components licensed under GPL version 3.0 or later or Creative Commons BY-SA must comply with the respective terms of those licenses, in addition to the obligations set forth in this license.

3. Viral Copyleft Requirement:

   a) Any Derivative Work created using the knowledge or information covered by this license must be released under the same ICL license, ensuring the perpetuation of open collaboration and perpetual openness.

   b) If an Incompatible Technology is required to use or interact with the Derivative Work, the use of such Incompatible Technology is explicitly prohibited unless the Incompatible Technology changes its license to the ICL. This license change must trigger a cascade effect, requiring all components of the Incompatible Technology to be licensed under the ICL.

4. Graphical Representations:

   a) This license explicitly covers the use of
      graphical representations, diagrams, visual
      schemas, and other related forms of visual
      information, including those that serve as
      conceptualizations, cataloging data, computer
      program execution specifications, or computer
      program code.

   b) Derivative Works must make all graphical representations, diagrams, visual schemas, and related elements openly available, allowing others to replicate and build upon them.

5. Perpetual Openness:

   a) All Works and Derivative Works, along with their associated knowledge and information, must be perpetually open and made available to the public, ensuring worldwide open collaboration.

   b) Any attempt to restrict, limit, or hinder the openness and availability of the Work or its Derivative Works is strictly prohibited.

6. Responsibilities:

   By accepting the terms of the ICL, one accepts the following responsibilities:

   a) The responsibility to properly attribute the work of other authors, whether works are licensed under the terms of the ICL or otherwise.

   b) The responsibility to license every Derivative Work under the terms of the ICL.

   c) The responsibility to verify that every component of a work protected under the ICL has a compatible license, and the responsibility to verify that the final work respects the terms of each component licences.

   d) The responsibility to release all theoretical, design, or implementation details of a Derivative Work under the ICL, including any graphical information representations, in a manner that allows anyone to benefit from the same work, commercially or non-commercially.

   e) The responsibility of not restricting others from using a work released under the ICL in any form, unless the other party violates the license terms. In case of a license violation, expedite legal action is advised after a reasonable period of public warning.

7. Disclaimer of Warranty:

The Work covered by the Informational Copyleft License (ICL) is provided &quot;as is&quot; and without any warranty, express or implied. The licensor of the Work provides no assurance that the Work will be free from defects or errors, or that it will meet the licensee's requirements or expectations. The licensor disclaims all warranties, including but not limited to the implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement of third-party rights.

The licensee assumes all risks associated with the use, application, and modification of the Work covered by the ICL. In no event shall the licensor be liable for any damages, whether direct, indirect, incidental, special, exemplary, or consequential, arising out of the use or inability to use the Work, even if the licensor has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
